# FTJ-based-memristor-neural-network
This is the code repository for our reserch "A physics-based predictive model for pulse design to realize high-performance memristive neural networks". 
## Introduction
This repository contains PyTorch implementation of neural network train in situ, and the network is train based on FTJ. The Ferroelectric tunnel junction(FTJ)-based neural network uses the LTP/LTD characteristics of the FTJ for the weight update. 
## Motivation
The training performance of memristive neural network depend on the pulse scheme applied to the constituent memristors. However, the design of the pulse scheme in most provious studies was approached in an empirical manner or through a trial-and-error method. We demonstrate a `physics-based predictive model` for the pulse design in memristive neural network. and this study may provide useful guidance for the pulse design in the experimental development of high-performance memristive neural networks.
## Dataset
All experiments are done on MNIST, as it provides a training set of 60,000 handwritten digits and a validation set of 10,000 handwritten digits. The images have size 28*28 pixels.
## Usage
To train the model, first we need to propose a model for the pulse design. In this code repository, we choose FTJ. Then, please run<br>

    training_mnist_FTJ.py

The LTP/LTD characteristics of FTJ is import:
```Python
from curve2 import Y
```
For three pulse schemes, Y can be import from curve1 (scheme1), curve2 (scheme2) or curve3 (scheme3).
In my experiments, I found that learning rate has a significant impact on the final performance and 0.2 is the learning rate I used (may not be the best).
